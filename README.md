# CodeWars Challenges (JavaScript)

Practicing problem solving and coding is a daily necessity, and here's where I'm placing all my solved challenges.

## The process:

1. Find a challenge

> Going to [CodeWars](www.codewars.com), I'll choose a challenge (what they call a 'Kata') based on what language I want to get better at and the difficulty I feel that I can manage. The language chosen is also usually the one I'm currently doing a project in, which definitely fosters my work quality. The difficulty is expressed on the website as 'kyu' (ex: the easiest questions are '8 kyu' and the hardest are '1 kyu'), but I've settled organizing things with the value of difficulty being positively coorelated (ex: 'difficulty 1' being the easiest, 'difficulty 8' being the hardest).

2. Taking a look at the problem

> First I review the instructions and note what the expected inputs/outputs are. I set up a word document to jot down my thoughts and likely solutions to the problem. All notes are placed into my blog so I can keep track of my progress over time (and cringe at some of my earlier work).

3. Gettin' it done

> There are plenty of ways to solve a problem, but there's a necessary hierarchy here. Above all, the code should be readable, intuitive, and simple. It should also be an attempt to reduce runtime growth (ex: preferring O(n) over O(n^2) ).

4. Testing & review

> If in the case that I cannot find a solution of any kind, I stop pulling my hair out, I humbly click on the 'unlock answers' to end my attempt, note that this problem stumped me and I need to practice similar questions, and study the solutions that other users have made.

> If I find a solution, I high-five myself and do a dance, and the submission allows you to compare your code with that of others. Sometimes I have an aswer that is comparable to the user-rated "best practices" or "cleverest" solution, but usually I'm an order or two away from the top-rated answer.

> In both cases, I spend some time looking over the best answer that is given by other users. I'm thoroughly in love with this form of learning, as it introduces me to different approaches towards discrete mathmatics. Sometimes I get a little _too_ into the concepts of the question and spend an evening on youtube listening to those fantastic CS educators approach the concept. Somewhere down the line, I go for a jog, and I move on to the next question.

> Nonetheless, I push the challenge onto here and keep track of them. If my solution is sub-par, I add (Can be better) to the file name as a flag to direct my learning and to remind myself to return to it in a week or so.
