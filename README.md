# CodeWars Challenges (JavaScript)

Practicing problem solving and coding is a daily necessity, and here's where I'm placing all my solved challenges.

# The process:

- Going to CodeWars.com, I'll choose a challenge (what they call a 'Kata') based on what language I want to get better at and the difficulty I feel that I can manage.

- Taking a look at the problem: first I review the instructions and note what the expected inputs/outputs are. I set up a word document to jot down my thoughts and likely solutions to the problem
